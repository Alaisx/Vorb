# Vorb - A modern library
- - -

## Hello
Welcome to the Vorb Multi-platform Toolkit and Utility Library. This site serves to aid to you in discovering how Vorb is structured and what features it provides.

## Modules
Vorb is designed in such a way that you can pick and choose which components you wish to use for your application needs. It provides you, the programmer, the flexibility to either make quick applications with its variety of utilities and wrappers, or you may directly access the lower level parts of the API and control flow. Vorb also attempts to achieve transparency and allow the programmer to access the important resources when it is necessary. Vorb is not a "batteries-included" library.

## Extensions
In addition to providing a set of core utilities necessary for any applications, Vorb also embraces the idea of extensions operating on top of the main library. These extensions could be as trivial as parsing YAML documents to something more difficult - a voxel engine. As software projects for games and even simple GUI apps grow larger and more complex, having the capability to speed up workflow and reduce boilerplate is a win on all levels.
